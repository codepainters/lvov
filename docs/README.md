# Docs and notes

Basic docs:

* [list of chips](chips.md) with both Russian and equivalent western symbols
* [map of the board](pcb_map.pdf) , also in [SVG](pcb_map.svg)
* [connectors pinout](connectors.md)



Below are my block-by-block analysis of the hardware:

* [CPU and PIO](cpu_pio.md)
* [Timing generator](timing.md)
* [RAM and ROM blocks](memories.md)
* [Video generator](video.md)

Note: I didn't bother with keyboard PCB, nothing interesting there. It's just yet another 8255...
